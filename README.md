# Guideline to install Docker on an Ubuntu machine on Azure

Here is the guideline that I combined when I was trying to install Docker on an Ubuntu machine on Azure

_PS : I need to run Docker on a VM on Azure to run Remote DevContainers on it. So, I wouldn't need to install and run Docker on my machine anymore. If you follow below guideline and install Docker on a machine on Azure, you can run Visual Studio Code on you machine and actual DevContainer on Azure. Also, you can benefit beast hardware specs you can find on Azure, such as, enourmous amount of CPU cores, gigabytes of RAM, fast GPUs, etc._
